# Issue: sending one message in a group produced N bubbles for one tap.
#
# Group text goes out as one SMS per recipient, so a single send leaves N rows
# in the system Sent box. `messages.sys_id` records only one of them, so sync
# adopted the first onto the local row and imported the rest as brand-new
# messages. `message_provider_ids` now records the full set.
#
# Asserts the local row count directly: one tap to a two-member group must
# leave exactly one message, and re-syncing must not grow it.
