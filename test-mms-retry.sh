# MMS download retry must distinguish transient from permanent failures.
#
# Before the fix every announced MMS was fetched exactly once and then dropped
# for five minutes regardless of why it failed, so a message lost to a brief
# data-network outage was never recovered, while a message the carrier had
# already discarded kept being reconsidered forever.
#
# The classification itself is unit-tested in MmsRetryTest; this script asserts
# the app-side bookkeeping that the unit tests cannot reach — that a completed
# download is forgotten, and that an announced-but-unsent row is not re-requested
# inside its backoff window.
