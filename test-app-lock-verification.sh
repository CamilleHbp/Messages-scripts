# Regression: changing the App lock setting must require a screen lock
# verification, in both directions, in both UIs.
#
# Two defects are covered. Disabling needed no check at all, and even enabling
# only asked whether a device credential *existed* -- it never actually asked
# for one, so the setting changed with no prompt on screen. Since the lock is
# what stands between a borrowed unlocked phone and the user's messages, turning
# it off is the sensitive direction, so both directions now go through a
# BiometricPrompt and only a verified result is applied.
#
# A device credential is set and cleared by this script, because a device with
# no screen lock cannot show the prompt at all and the toggle is meant to be
# refused there. The original credential state is restored at the end.
